- Hi, I'm Stewart.

- My background is in Chemical Engineering, and lately I'm interested in all things data and analytics and have been on a mission learning Data Science.
As you, the person reading this, may know - there is a lot to learn.

- So, with that being the case I've been methodically working learning statistics to Pandas to Machine Learning to Tableau, through online learning platforms such as Codecademy, EdX and Coursera, as well as signing up to great newsletters such as Data Elixir and communities such as DataTalks.Club. 

- Recently I've been learning Apache Spark and Tensor Flow.

- I will be uploading my project work to github to have project work in one place, as well as being able to use it as a reference to show people what I have been working on.
